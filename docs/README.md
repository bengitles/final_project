data/
--> ANES-2008-Survey-Questions.txt: Prof Chris's original survey question dataset
--> Batch_x_batch_results.csv: various batches of responses to the survey. We only used the largest file (951779) for our clustering
--> Batch_95164_mock_clustered_candidates.csv: mock example of our Crowdflower output
--> full_voting_dataset.csv: Full 150 entry (50 distinct pairs) of voting that we facilitated on Crowdflower using our clustered centroids as candidates
--> mock_aggregated.csv: mock example of our aggregated data after receiving ideal candidate data from Crowdflower

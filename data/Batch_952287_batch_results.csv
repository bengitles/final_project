I'm thinking doing what work and at what wage? When he and Ryan faked the soup kitchen trip that really ticked me off.  They had no honest plan on going there.  They waited till the people had left then Ryan and his pathetic wife strapped on aprons to fake a dish washing scene.

Our debt is unsustainable at its current levels and will result in economic catastrophe if not dealt with in aa substantial manner.  It is weakening our national security by making us beholden to creditor countries and weakening our position globally.  It is lowering morale and consumer confidence and has lowered our credit rating already and continues to grow.","We must eliminate our dependence on foreign fuel and insulate ourselves and our economy from instability in oil-producing regions.  We can kickstart our economy and avoid inflation if we eliminate our reliance on mid-eatern oil and will have less at stake in the area and thereby help reduce tensions.  This will spark investment, job creation and stability in our economic systemandhelp us remain strong and less reliant on radical governments.","Our policies in theMiddle East and Afghanistan have not shown benefits and have fostered anti-american sentiment on an increasingbasis.  This reduces our image world wide and increases the likelihood of terrorist attacks.  Whhen we remove troops from Iraq or Afghanistan, conditions seem to worsen to what they were prior to our involvement and it seems like a tragic waste of lives and resources that could have been better invested domestically in infrastructure and alternative energies.","The widening disparity betweenthe richand poor and the erosion of the middle class is serious and will result in increased tensions politically making it likely that Congressional inaction and political name calling will continue with neither party working cooperatively to restore our economy and shorten the gap between the rich and poor.","I think they were protesting what they view as american imperialism or the attempts of our government to install pro-western secular regimes that they feel oppress their citizens.  They also claim to see it as blasphemous that our troops occuoy their holy land and they do not like our support of Israel and feel we collude with Israel to exterinate Palestinians.  they see us as imposing our will on them to pursue our greed and national interests (oil) and that we disrespect their faith and culture.","I think hewas viewed as the candidate who stood the best chance of beating obama in the national election and was a little less far right than some of his opponents.  He also had a better funded campaign that allowed him to remain in the race until it became unavoidable that he would gain enough delegates to win the nomination.  He was, in my opinion, the best alternative in a relative weak field overall when viewed at the national evel and had the credentials considered necessary to beating Obama.","I think Santorum was a little too far to the right and his campaign was not able to draw enough donors until too late in the race to sustain his bid for the nomination.

I have health insurance coverage through work, however, I know of many family and friends who do not have coverage and who do not get the health care they need because they cannot afford to pay for it (or they use the emergency room as their primary caregiver which means that I am ultimately paying for their health care because if they cannot afford health care coverage they cannot afford the ER costs.","The economy.

His wife has never had to work since she's been married to him.  Neither one of them know what poverty is like.  Neither one of them have ever been poor.  How would they relate to other Americans?  Probably not very well because they wouldn't be able to understand what other normal Americans go through on a daily basis just to survive.","Yes","I think he wasn't given a fair chance to prove himself during his first term in office.  He came in to a bad situation; the economy wasn't the greatest when he came into office.  Now, everyone is blaming him for the bad things that have happened in this country since he has taken office but he is not the only one that should be blamed for it.","Yes","I am a Federal employee and I haven't had a raise since January of 2010.

We don't want someone promising us the world and then failing us once again.  It's time for America to be the great country it is again.  We have the right to demand this of our leaders and hopefully we will have the opportunity to experience great leadership once again in the very near future.","Healthcare.  I am not sure what is going to become of Obamacare if he is elected again.  I just don't think such a program will work in the United States like it has worked in other countries.  There are too many bugs in this program that still need to be worked out before it can be implemented on a full scale basis.  This will probably take years of research and testing; but once this has been completed, it will be worth the while.","The war in Iraq.  When are we pulling those men and women out of there?  I thought they were supposed to be doing it soon.  I don't see any action yet.  I keep hearing about stories of men and women being killed over there and it is heart-breaking.  We have no business being over there.  Let them fight their own war and keep the US out of their business.","Defense spending.  I think we spend too much and I think we need to stop.  Our country is going broke spending all of this money on defense when we need to help our own get back on their feet, get jobs, get out of poverty.  There is too much concern over other countries and how we can help them.  How about our country helping our own citizens?  Is that such a stretch?","I think they were trying to kill as many Americans as possible because they thought their race was superior to the American race.  They were wrong.  Most of the people at the World Trade Center were foreigners.  When you go to New York City, more than half of the people that work and live there do not speak English well enough to be understood.  I think the terrorists were sorely mistaken when they crashed into the World Trade Center because there were hardly any Americans killed.","Because he is a millionaire and he knows a lot of influential people that helped him to win the nomination.  I don't think this will help him win the election though because I think that the American public realizes that he is only out for himself and he is not out to benefit the US at all if he is elected.","Because he really didn't want to deal with any of it.  I think his name was slammed into the mud because of all of his problems anyway (he lived in one place but didn't pay taxes and sent his kids to a better school in which he didn't pay the school taxes either).

I have waited for 40 years to see women get equal pay for the same work and I am very disappointed that this hasn't happened. I am very fearful that if Romney is elected he will work to take women's rights backwards. I think that we need more powerful women involved in the government on equal footing with men. Hilary is one, but we need more. I truly believe that more powerful women in government would make a big difference. Romney has said some things that make me believe it would be a huge step backwards if he is elected.","The economy is the second most important thing. Obama needs more time to get the economy back on track. Bush created a mess. It will take more time to gets things back on track. I object to the thinking that giving the really rich tax breaks is good for the economy. If this kind of trickle down theory worked, it would have worked by now.","Politically, I think that gay rights is a big problem. I feel it is not fair to withhold rights from partners just because they are the same sex. I think that politicians need to face this issue and coordinate gay rights nationally.","I think my second choice is discrimination. I think that many black are still not afforded their full rights as citizens.","I think the terrorists were looking to make an attack on the American way of life, to further their belief that we are evil and against God. America is about different people working together no matter what their religious beliefs are, the terrorists think that their way is the only way.","I think he was considered personable, not too old, not too young. I think his business background has a lot to do with it too. I think he was a better alternative to ""Mr. Hothead"" Christy.","He was not as strong a speaker as Romney.

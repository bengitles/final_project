The minorities of the population (the poor and the rich) are the least effected, since the poor have programs already in place to assist them, and the rich are in a better position to absorb the blow from the bad economy (although technically since they have the most it stands to reason that they lost the most, but they can still get by easily on their ""diminished"" resources). The largest portion of the population thought, the middle class, has been damaged the worse. Simply because they often have too many assets to qualify for assistance programs (many because they own their homes, albeit with the bank) and yet they have suffered severe enough economic downturns that they have no personal resources to fall back on. Best case scenario they are getting by, but many, when they lost their jobs, lost their homes, their savings,etc. On top of that, without their jobs most weren't able to pay for health insurance, although they didn't stop getting sick, and this meant they were put even further in debt.","I think the second most important issue was the job situation and the economy.  With the economic downfall so many companies either closed down or downsized, laying off thousands and thousands of workers. Even though the government has tried to encourage employers to hire the unemployed, through tax breaks,incentives, etc, employers are hesitant to make large amounts of new hiring for fear of the uncertain economic future and have been staying more in the what and see mode before making expansions.","Although many people use ""political problems"" synonymously with governmental problems, I feel they are completely different issues. The most important political problem I see us facing right now is that we can't get the politicians to stop the infighting with each other and get down to business. They spend so much time tearing their political opponents down and blocking any legislation that is proposed by their opponents that they have very little time left to actually work on the countries problems. If they actually do pass some legislature it is usually so watered down or bogged down with red tape, or even worse has so many special interest items tagged onto it that it no longer truly addresses whatever it was originally intended to address. This infighting also causes the average citizen to lose trust in their government and obscures the facts of what the actual problems our country is facing and thus prevents them from helping come up with possible solutions or at the very least getting on board when a solution is found.","What I see as the second most important political problem facing us, is very closely related to what I feel the most important problem is, but is really different. I think the second most important problem is our seemingly lack of forward momentum in our country. Once a solution is decided on by a majority, everyone needs to get on board and try to make it work, even if they didn't originally vote or push for that particular solution, it is their duty to do everything in their power to give it a fair and impartial chance to work. That means, once our governmental bodies have decided on a solution for one of our countries problems, EVERY politician needs to make it their job to explain the solution to their constituents and do everything in their power to make the solution work. If after a fair shake, it is proven that this solution isn't doing what it was supposed to, then we can move onto another solution. But currently it seems that once something is decided, the opponents continue to tear it apart, which keeps the citizens from trying to make it work and everything continues to stagnate and flounder instead of moving forward.","I don't know all of what they were trying to accomplish by their actions, because who can truly say what others think and feel.  I do believe they were trying to cause widespread fear and hopelessness in our country and I think they were trying to look brave and powerful to inspire fear in other countries too. Unlike most foes that countries have faced through the ages, where they have wanted to conquer and control the nations they attacked I don't think that the terrorists really want to take over our country. It is hard to believe, but ultimately I think they would like to wipe the ""unbelieving nations"" off the map completely, and if they can't do that, then to terrorize them to the point where they will stay out of the Islamic nations and even more important, keep their materialistic ""sinful"" products and ideas out of them.","I think he had more money available to him for campaigning and he already had more national name recognition. I think he was saying what some people wanted to hear, he has a certain marketability and I am sure that many people thought he would have a better chance to beat the President in November.","I basically think he just didn't have the things that Mitt Romney had, namely the campaign resources,the marketability,the name recognition and people didn't think he would have as good a chance to beat the President in November as Mitt Romney would.","Don't know","Vice President","Don't know","Don't know","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A moderate amount","Increased","A moderate amount","Increased","A moderate amount","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Decreased","A moderate amount","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A moderate amount","Increased","A moderate amount","Increased","A moderate amount","Larger percent","Larger","1.

I am currently uninsured, and I will soon need to either buy health insurance or pay a penalty on my income taxes.

I don't like Romney's plan of ""keeping the good parts, but repealing the rest."" Didn't our Supreme Court just rule that this was not feasible-the law as a whole fails if any one part is thrown out?","The economy is the second most important issue. High unemployment and the slow rate of job growth have been very problematic. I expect the unemployment rate to improve over the next year or two regardless of who becomes president. I think Obama handled the stimulus package and recovery process well considering the terrible state of our economy in late 2008 and early 2009. The bailout of GM and Chrysler was successful, and I don't think a Republican administration would have done it. Therefore, Obama has done some good things for the economy, and I trust him with a second term.","The most important political problem in this country is political extremism and the unwillingness of the ideological stalwarts to compromise with the other party. To give one example, many Republicans have been bullied into signing an agreement to never vote for any kind of tax increase (with the threat of being voted out of office in the next election). This is a dangerous commitment in this economic climate-how can we expect to seriously make a dent in the deficit without raising taxes? The are plenty of Democrats unwilling to compromise on their issues as well.","I think the second most important political problem is the influence of money on politicians and political campaigns. There is so much money at stake from lobbyists and wealthy donors that no politician is immune to its influence. Our politicians don't even really serve the average constituent in their districts-they primarily vote in accordance with campaign contributors.","Maybe the terrorists were trying to punish the U.S. for the role it has taken in the Middle East. The terrorists wanted to destroy a symbol of democracy, the Capitol Building, a symbol (and center) of our military strength, the Pentagon, and symbols of our financial system, the World Trade Center. Maybe the terrorists wanted Americans to be so frightened that they would lose faith in these institutions entirely.","Mitt Romney is politically experienced (he was the governor of Massachusetts), but he's not perceived as a Washington, D.C. insider (he's never served as a senator or representative in Washington). He has a well-known name and political pedigree (his father was the governor of Michigan and also ran for the Republican presidential nomination one year, I believe). He is a successful businessman and is perceived as a strong leader in both the public and the private sector (he headed the Salt Lake City Olympic Committee after it was caught up in a bribery scandal). Romney is a devoted member of his church, and a commitment to religion (especially some form of Christianity) is very important to the Republican party.","I think Santorum was considered weak regarding business and economic experience. I think some Republicans liked him simply because he strongly opposed gay marriage and abortion rights, and these are hot-button issues that draw fervent supporters.

Being able to get back to an economy that is growing. To be able to pay our debts and prosper rather than borrow money and always worry about when the bill comes due.","Illegal immigration. I really think they should make a real effort to sop the inflow of immigrants in general. There aren't many well paying jobs as it is and if employers know they can hire others cheaper they will to keep wages down. Those who are criminals by coming here illegally don't deserve a path to citizenship, we don't need more criminal in this country.","Grid lock, the refusal of the parties -republicans in particular - to compromise on anything. All the talk about the great hings they will do is hampered by their steadfast determination to engage in infighting and promote their party at the expense of the country. The political class has gotten a real hubris and a feeling of entitlement with all the incumbents who have essentially made a career of being government leeches and living a lifestyle of entitlement and privilege while the people paying the bills suffer.","Energy, we need to switch away from the old sources and gain not only independence from them but also a real sustainable source of energy. Being secure in the energy department would allow for alot more certainty in the manufacturing sector and allow for much less fear-mongering from the political class.

 The terrorist probably believed that they would somehow bring the country to it's knees or cause massive strife in the country with their actions. Maybe they thought they were striking a blow in the holy war - their single-minded pursuit of one - in the name of religion. The middle east has been hitting each other over the head with rocks since history began largely due to religious disputes. I really think it is in their DNA, they just don't know how to do anything except oppose anything that impugned their religion, and they see that everywhere in everything new, different or progressive.","Fuck.
 I guess it really had to do with he was really the most shining smile, the least likely to really have a backbone and do something mid evil if he got the nod. Romney is a empty suit so to speak, he LOOKS the part and can almost sound the part on good days. He embodies white, rich, old  and privileged. I guess that is what they were looking for.","You know he really did win Iowa - it just took weeks for the vote to really be tallied and certified.
 I happen to live in Iowa and was following the story closely.

 I wouldn't say he lost it, really didn't trust the guy but overall he seemed the type that may hit a point where he stood for something and with all the god talk you sure don't want to be at odds with a real christian when you pretend to believe the talk too.
 I guess he would have been a bit too unpredictable and dangerous to choose. If he went off the rails but was popular the party would have a hard time tearing him down or distancing themselves. I feel sorry for the guy a bit - the chance was stolen from.

Bush","Yes, voted","John McCain","Yes","The conserative stance to approaching tackling the economic crisis is one reason I would vote for a Republican. I would also vote for a republican because I prefer how they handle the tax policy. I am unhappy with the way the Democrats have handled the healthcare plan. I would vote Republican in hopes that they do away with that healthcare plan. I am also very unhappy with the national budget deficit. It seems to be getting worse and worse with a Democrat in office. I think a Republican in office can stop it from getting worse.","Yes","My viewpoints about social issues are not conservative for the most part. While I have a conservative viewpoint when it comes to economic issues I don't agree most of the conservative viewpoints when it comes to issues such as mariage, and abortion. I would not want to vote for a Republican if he wanted to make Abortion illegal. I also wouldn't want to vote for a Republican who was against gay marraige. I also agree more with Democaratic viewpoints when it comes to protecting the environment than I do with Republican viewpoints. My views on gun control are also more Democratic than they are Republican.","No","I am for gun control, I see guns as being a problem. Republicans want to protect the right for Americans to have guns. Democrats want to create more strict gun control laws. I want stricter laws also. I also am pro-choice and want gay marriage to be a possibility. I would vote for a democrat based on this. I would vote for a democrat if he would want to vote for a democrat if he allowed some stem cell research also.","Yes","In times of crisis, I wouldn't want to vote for a Democrat if he was hesitant to go to war. I also wouldn't want to vote for a Democrat if he wanted to get rid of the death penalty. I also wouldn't want to vote for a democrat who wanted to raise the taxes. I don't believe raising the taxes is the answer. I believe in cutting government spending. I wouldn't want to vote for a democrat who wants to handle the healtchare plan the way it is currently being handled.","60","20","75","15","70","70","80","3","0","5","54","10","60","20","45","67","Yes","I like thw Democrats stance on most social issues. I like that for the most part they are pro-choice. That many support gay marriage and protecting peoples individual expression. I like that they want stricter gun control laws and they want to protect peoples rights as far as their differences go. ( sexuality, identity etc.)","Yes","I don't like the way the Democratic party handles the economy. I don't agree with the idea of raising taxes to stimulate economic growth. I think they are making the economy much worse in the recent years. The deficit just continues to grow. They are doing nothing to stop it.","Yes","I like that the Republican party wants to strengthen laws regarding illegal immigration. Living where I live in Arizona, illegal immigration is a huge problem and the Democratic party is doing nothing to help make this situation any better. I  believe in stricter laws and I like that the Republicans want to do this.","Yes","I don't like the Republicans consevative viewpoints on marriage. I don't believe that marriage should just be between a man and a woman. All couples deserve the right to get married if they choose. They should be able to have the same rights as any other couple. They should be able to be on the same healthcare plan etc.","Better when control is split","Very similar","Very similar","Better","Yes","Somewhat","Better","Somewhat","Yes","Yes","Yes","Occasionally","Yes","Rarely","Yes","Occasionally","No","Never","Yes","Rarely","Yes","Fairly often","No","Never","Yes","Occasionally","Some of the time","Very well","A moderate amount","A lot","Very successfully","A few of them","Moderate; middle of the road","Conservative","Liberal","Conservative","Liberal","Conservative","Care a good deal","Mitt Romney","Will be close","Mitt Romney","Win by quite a bit","Yes, voted in primary or caucus","Mitt Romney","Yes, have a duty","Disagree somewhat","Agree somewhat","Disagree somewhat","Disagree somewhat","Gotten worse","Much","Get worse","Somewhat","Get worse","Much","Get better","Much","Worse","Somewhat","About the same","Worse","Somewhat","More","Could borrow from someone","5000","Can't be too careful","Once in a while","Republicans","About the same by both","About the same by both","Weaker","Disagree","Republican","Not very strong","I do not consider myself an Independent","Not too well","Not too well","Not too well","Not too well","Not too well","Not too well","Quite well","Extremely well","Quite well","Quite well","Extremely well","Extremely well","Quite well","Extremely well","3","Very important","6","3","Fewer services","Somewhat","Very important","More services","A lot","Fewer services","Slightly","5","Very important","3","5","More","Slightly","Very important","Less","Somewhat","More","Somewhat","6","Extremely important","1.

I beleive the economy is in severe crisis and is not showing any signs of substantial improvement. I wanted the candidates to convince me of how they are going to address this issue. It was important to me that they have a solid plan and a solution in place. They needed to convince me of this.","The second most important issue is illegal immigration/ strengthenign the borders. What are they going to do to protect the American citizens? Are they going to just allow a path to citizenship for the people that are breaking the law or are they going to protect the rights of Americans? What about the borders? All the crime that is coming over the borders and infiltrating our country? It's a mess and something needs to be done.","I definetly feel the economy is the most important issue. So many people and families are struggling. Our country just keeps borrowing money from other countries. Our deficit keeps growing and growing. This needs to stop. If this continues what is going to happen next. Our people deserve better. They deserve to be able to provide for their families and have a sense of economic security.","The unemployement rate is still way to high. College graduates are not getting jobs. And among those that can, many people are highly educated and working fast food jobs. They can't make a decent living. People are struggling and suffering. The economy needs to be stimulated so more jobs can be created. Stop sending all the jobs oversees. Keep them here in America so our own people can be employed.","I believe those people were just plain evil. They wanted to harm our country. They don't agree with the way we live. They don't agree with the amount of power our country has. They don't agree with the aid and support our country gives to Israel. They don't agre with our military presence in the Middle East. They just want to hurt others. They wanted to cripple our country.","I think he is the most solid candidate. He is well educated and is a great buisness man. I think people recognize that and how that can help our economy to recover. He's done good things for the state of Massachusetts. His healthcare plan for the state was also praised.","I think Rick is to conservative for a great deal of people. I also think he failed as a whole to address many issues that are important to the country. He chose to focus to much on National security and failed to address the other problems. I think he didn't have good answers to how he was going to fix the economic problems.","prime minister UK","Vice President","Speaker of the House","Chief Justice","Increased","A moderate amount","Increased","A little","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A great deal","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A great deal","Increased","A little","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Should not determine","The same","4","Very important","3","6","Favor","A great deal","Extremely important","Favor","A great deal","Favor","Moderately","Favor","A great deal","Oppose","A great deal","Favor","Strongly","More difficult","Extremely important","No","1.

But, as far as the Republicans go, I might vote for a Republican candidate because they are for eliminating wasteful spending and trying to pay down the national defecit. Their views are more conservative and I guess I would consider myself more on the conservative side, than liberal. Overall, I might vote for a Republican because they are more in favor of eliminating the Federal Government's role in American citizans' decision-making on some issues.","Yes","As far as Mitt Romney is concerned, frankly, he just scares me. When I look at him, I do not see an honest, caring man. I see a ruthless business man that will do anything in his power to save the millionaires in this country money, including himself. He seems very deceitful and dishonest and I would not trust him if he was elected president.

Honestly, I am not very knowledgeable about either the Democratic or Republican parties, but in my opinion, the Democrats have done more good for this country, than the Republicans.","Yes","The Democrats really seem to enjoy spending, rather than trying to conserve U.S. funds and reduce the national defecit.

The next elected president needs to get people in America back to work, with higher pay, better benefits and simply higher-quality of jobs. Also, jobs need to STOP being outsourced to other countries. Doing this will not help to jumpstart the U.S. economy. There are a great number of jobs in America that need people to fill them. There are also many potential industries that the government could invest in, to create more, better-quality, higher-paying jobs.","Second on the list is healthcare. Obamacare is a BAD idea! It will hurt so many more Americans than it will help. It is going to cost this country trillions of dollars, which we don't have, and will have to borrow from other countries, like China. I think every American should be given their civil liberties back. We should be able to choose which healthcare providers we want, and which insurance companies we want. But, in my opinion, this country has more than enough money to pay for high-quality healthcare for every single one of its citizens, at no cost to them! There are more areas to cut spending from, that are not vital programs. Cutting money from Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security is NOT a good idea!","Corruption!!! Every single politician in this country is corrupt, one way or another. If we want to fix the problems this nation is facing, we need to totally change the way we think about politics and elect some honest, hard-working people, that actually care about middle class America. Without the middle class, we have no America!","I guess I would just have to repeat my previous statements about corruption in our political system in this country.","I honestly do not know what their ultimate goal was. Personally, I think it was meant to send a message to the American government, that the United States is vulnerable to attack and it is possible to attack Americans on their own soil. Also, I think the terrorists were trying to scare the entire nation, and I believe they accomplished their mission.","I think the only reason Romney won the nomination is because he had more money than the other candidates, to spend on advertizing and getting his name out there. Previous to this election, I had never even heard the name Mitt Romney.","I really do not know enough about Rick Santorum to form an educated opinion about him, but again, I think it all comes down to whoever has the most money to spend on their campaign.","Don't know","Vice-President","Don't know","Don't know","Increased","A great deal","Increased","A great deal","Increased","A great deal","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A moderate amount","Decreased","A moderate amount","Increased","A moderate amount","Cut out entirely","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Decreased","A moderate amount","Increased","A little","Larger percent","Larger","6","Somewhat important","5","7.

I disagree with the republican party most of the time on foreign affairs and the war on terror.  I dislike that they are pro-life and against gay rights.

All of the horrible comments made by Republican party members about rape and women have just made me so angry.  I feel like we are seriously at risk of losing our right to choose based on a few overly conservative and evangelical right-wing nutsos.","The second most important issue for me in this election is social policy.  I am strongly in favor of women's rights, gay rights, and programs to help bring people out of poverty.  I also strongly favor maintaining the separation of church and state and dislike the thought of having openly evangelical candidates in high positions in our government.","The economy.  It is in a terrible state and some serious changes need to be made.  I'm no economics major, but even I can tell that our standard of living is not increasing, in fact I believe for the majority of people it is backsliding.  The rich are getting richer and everyone else is getting poorer.  I do not believe that top-down economic policies work.","I think the second most important political problem facing the country today is our foreign policy and involvement in foreign affairs.  I think it says a lot that the vast majority of other countries vastly prefer that we re-elect Obama.  I do not want a Hawk back in the presidency.  I feel like we have spent too much and lost too many lives in the war on terror.  At the same time, I also feel like we have to balance our involvement with defense spending at home and with serving as a role model for other nations in our involvement with other problems outside the US.","I think they were trying to paralyze us with fear.  I think they were trying to shake our belief in our country to keep us safe.  I think they were trying to make us panic and react without thinking things through.  I think they were sending a message to us and to other countries that even small groups of people can have power.","I think Mitt Romney won the nomination because of money.  I think he out fundraised everyone else and he also has very deep pockets of personal funds that he could use while campaigning.  I also think that he successfully reached out to moderates and conservatives within his party.  I also think that he did a good job of downplaying the Mormonism issue for the Christian evangelicals in his party.","I think he lost the nomination because he didn't have the money or the power.  I think he was a much more likeable guy than Mitt Romney and that if I had to choose between the two of them, I would have chosen Santorum in a heartbeat.

Without addressing issues of climate change and the unsustainable ways in which we're living, we are headed on a path for destruction, and then none of the other problems in the country will even matter, because we won't have an earth to live on.","The environment/climate change is certainly the most important political problem facing the US today, but neither of the candidates have even spoken about it!  It is such a big problem that both of them are too afraid to even tackle it.  To do something about climate change, we would have to take a SERIOUS look at the American lifestyle, and we'd have to implement SERIOUS changes with SERIOUS economic implications, which no one wants to deal with.","Health care is the second most important political problem.

- I support the Republican ideal of deregulating the economy, although we now have such a corrupt system of lobbying and corporate power that I don't know how much we can do to fix it with one election.  At least they are more in line with a constitutional model, rather than a progressive, wealth-redistribution model.
- The Republicans didn't take God out of their convention...","No","- In general, I think many politicians are bought out/paid for, no matter their political party.  Romney has a history of economic success, but that doesn't mean he's completely transparent in all his motivations, influences, etc.
- Some of the Republican party seems a little too tied to the ""fundamentalist"" Christian right-wing, without regard for whether their teachings are really sound or in the best interest of the people.","No","- I appreciate many of the Democratic ideals of helping the poor, looking out for minorities, etc.  I think a lot of Democrats have their hearts totally in the right place and are trying to do a lot of good.","Yes","- Wealth redistribution

It just needs to be channeled toward responsible change, not whatever cool change the progressive voices of the the nation are espousing the most loudly.","Yes","Slavish devotion to progressive cultural ideals.  Desire to create a nanny state, because apparently, Americans are not intelligent or self-disciplined enough to carry on their own lives without help from the government.  Some of their social justice-type programs are a great idea, but not when they are reinforcing the negative behaviors and patterns that landed people in poverty/unwanted pregnancy/crime in the first place.  I think the poor/uneducated/underpriviledged need to be helped, but that help has historically come from the church and from private philanthropy.  The government does a pretty inefficient job of it.  
We can't keep taxing and taxing and going into debt to prop up our welfare state.  It's completely unsustainable.","Yes","The wisdom of tradition, a voice of reason to balance out the ""change, change, change"" of the democratic party.  Age, experience, and traditional values.  Dedication to economic frugality and a balanced budget (at least among some Republicans).","Yes","Like it or not, money corrupts, and power corrupts, and the Republican party, just like the Democratic party, is full of both.  There is still too much favor being given to corporations that are busy polluting, gaining profits, and ignoring what the consumers/employees really need and want.  
Also, some conservative Republicans are so entrenched in the way things have always been done, or the way Pat Robertson thinks things should be, that they ignore what is true and right.

He represents the religious right's beliefs that marriage is man and woman only.  He feels okay with thrusting his religious beliefs on other such as his pro-life stance.  He's just another rich white guy who in reality has had a very easy life and money has been a major factor in his success.  I don't think he has any concept of truly struggling to survive.  Throughout his campaign he has wavered on issues and hasn't taken a clear stance on anything.  Details of his plans are unclear.

He doesn't get everything right and he admits that.  He believes in a high level of personal freedom while also demonstrating that we should be willing to help each other in times of need.","Yes","I think he needed to crack down much harder on Wall Street.  I don't think much has changed there.  I think fines against the major banks should have been huge and complete leadership changes mandated.

It bugs me that a group can be so narrow-minded that they want to limit freedom based on religion while also trying to proclaim that they offer the best route to more individual freedom.  It really disturbs me how much religion has a control on politics in this nation.  It is scary to me.","I think social issues have been an issue.  We are moving forward towards national health care which is a good thing.  We are also still struggling as a nation as far as our economy and jobs.  I watched the debates and listened to how each party proposed to work on and fix our domestic social issues.  They have been the one area that has really defined the candidates in my mind.","I think our economy in general.  We do have to keep moving forward.  We need to be a strong country financially in order to make a lasting impact on the world.  At the same time, this is a hotly debated political issue.  Currently, I think Obama is growing the economy slowly but effectively.  I think slower growth is going to be more lasting and permanent.  The Republicans want to slash and pull back like crazy.  I worry that this approach will provide a huge immediate impact that will quickly backfire and fail and leave us in a worsened condition.  I think that efforts to be bi-partisan about this issue have failed miserably thanks to the Republicans and I think it is the Democrats alone who are going to get this country moving forward on a strong, lasting foundation.","I think the next big issue is national health care.  I think it's time we offered health care by the government for everyone.  The health insurance racket is over.  We shouldn't have to choose between health insurance and a mortgage payment.  At the same time insurance shouldn't dictate the health care we receive, i.e. delaying a medical procedure in order to prove it is really necessary.  I think the Democrats need to go full steam ahead with a nationalized health care plan.  The Republicans will fight it greatly.  And not because they are against it but because the health insurance lobby is forcing them to do so.  I think in the long run nationalized health care will cost less to the taxpayers through preventative care.","I think they were trying to inflict emotional pain on the US.  It was also an act of power.  Not only were we emotionally impacted by the loss of life, but we as a nation were also scared about our previously unknown vulnerability.  Suddenly we found ourselves unprotected and afraid.  That made a huge impact on our psyche and our budgets.  I think they wanted to show the US that they could get us in ways that we could not control.  They wanted to show that it is just about guns and bombs.  We are not in our own little impenetrable bubble.  I think they wanted to show us that we need to be more tolerant of others and decrease our arrogance.","I think he won because he heavily catered to the religious conservatives of the Republican party.  He formed a campaign based on taking back the country from the crazy leftist Democrats and making it a utopia for the white Christians - and they bought it hook, line and sinker.  I think he said whatever he thought needed to be said in order to gain support.  He stayed far right while the others in his party were more in the middle and split up the moderate votes between them while alienating the far right members of the party who swung behind Romney.","I'm not really sure.

High prices, lack of work. So many Americans make too much money to get the help they need, yet the money they do make is not enough to adequately provide and care for an average family. Most Americans (middle class) are arely making ends meet. Jobs are difficult to find (at least jobs that have a decent salary).

Personally the welfare of Americans at home far exceed the importance of the many other issues the government is involved with (i.e. Syria)","Foreign policy. The United States has spend the last decade in war. And while we do have a responsibility to assist and protect our neighbors, we need to concentrate more on taking care of our own problems at home. It is difficult for Americans who are out of work, struggling to make ends meet, to see our country spending time and money for the benefit of other countries, when our own land is suffering.","National debt.  If we don't or won't concentrate on our spending and our ever increasing debt, the United States will continue to weaken and will ultimately be controlled by other nations. Our nation has always been viewed by others as a nation of strength. We are losing that position and are becoming more and more vulnerable as we continue to get further and further in debt.","Lack of unity betwen our leaders.

Definitely will vote","Yes, voted","John Kerry","Yes, voted","Barack Obama","No","At this point, I doubt I would ever vote republican.  I remember years ago, I voted occaisionally for republicans but not now.  Republicans have proven (by their actions) that they support their party over what's good for the country & I simply cannot support someone who thinks like that.  For instance, when the better jobs numbers came out last month, did they say, 'that's good that we seem to be doing better, the country is coming out of the recession'?  No!  They said, the numbers must be wrong because from their party perspective, that's what they wanted to believe!!","Yes","The main reason is because he lies so much!!  So far as I know, practically everyone in this values honesty, so why should we accept so many lies from out politicians?  In '08, Romney wrote an editorial entitled Let Detroit Go Bankrupt & yet now, because he needs Ohio to elect him, we are supposed to believe that what Obama did was what he suggested!  No, what he suggested was to let Detroit go bankrupt to reduce their financial obligations & then borrow money from private companies, not the govt.  The main problem with that argument is that, back then, during the worst part of the recession NO private companies were loaning money & certainly not the amount of money the car companies would have needed.

Another lie, he recently said that due to the bailout that Obama extended to the car companies, Chrysler would be moving all american jobs related to Jeep production to China.  (First he said Italian buyers were shipping them to China)  This was such an obvious lie that even the executives at Chrysler refuted this argument!!  Chrysler said no US jobs would be leaving, they are only allowing China to create jobs to produce vehicles that would be sold to Chinese buyers.

The next really big lie he told was about Medicare.  He said that under Obamacare, they 'cut' $700 billion.....but that's also untrue!  Obama cut payments to some medicare providers but he did not cut services to seniors or the poor!  Interestingly, Ryan's budget (Romney's running mate) cuts exactly that same amount in services to seniors & the poor.  As Bill Clinton said, ""it takes brass to accuse the other guy of doing what you did!!""

Basically, Romney will say whatever he thinks will get him elected.  He has no spine, no conviction & certainly no courage!!!","Yes","yes, most definitely!  I love Obama.....mostly because he really cares about people!!  All of the things he has done in office demonstrate that.

The first bill he signed was the Lily Ledbetter Act which allows women more ability to get justice if they have been paid less than their men counterparts.

He bailed out the auto industry even though it was unpopular at the time.

He created the first national health care system, even though his advisors said he shouldn't do it.  It was too big of a risk, they said.  And it did become unpopular due to republican lies about it.  But I think once people are able to see what it will do for them, they will like it.

The most recent example of the way he cares is FEMA.  During hurricane Sandy, he made getting help to those people a prioroity!  Even republican Governor Chris Christie (a Romney spokesperson) gave Obama a lot of credit for getting that done so quickly & efficiently!  And Obama showed people the way he feels about them when he went to NJ recently & a lady who approached him was crying because she had lost her home & business.  He hugged her for a long time & then gave some orders to his top FEMA guy about how to get this done.  Then he assured the lady that eventually, it will be ok.

Why would you NOT want this man as President?","No","Overall, I think Obama has done a great job!  There have been some things I've disagreed with like when he agreed to extend the Bush tax cuts but I know he just did that so that he could get republicans to authorize things he wanted like the payroll tax cut & unemployment insurance.","2","98","98","100","0","99","100","3","0","98","5","98","5","0","100","0","Yes","the democratic party always tries to increase rights for the average person.  They tend to focus on things like civil rights, justice & doing things that are good for people like looking out for the poor (medicare, medicaid & social security)

That's why I like them, they may not always win but they never give up trying.

I heard someone on the news recently who said, the democrats message is ""we've got your back"" while the republicans message is ""you're on your own"".  I agree with that.","No","sometimes I wish they were more organized like republicans but they're getting better at getting their message out.","No","all you ever hear from republicans is tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts!  I understand why some are focused on money but there are some things in this world that are more important than money!  Like compassion, national security & helping your neighbor overcome a difficult time.

Tax cuts & cutting spending is not always the answer to every problem!  And while we're on the subject, the house republicans solution to balancing the budget is to give the very rich more tax cuts & cutting as much spending as possible.  That's not balance by any definition!!!  Even NY Mayor Bloomberg recently said you can't balance the budget unless you cut spending along WITH raising taxes.","Yes","Everything!  How much time do you have?

Well, first of all, republicans seem to focus on fictional arguments.  They don't like gay marriage because christianity says it's wrong.  But you also can't support the idea of freedom for all if you say some people have rights but then you say that some other groups can't have the same rights.

Todd Akin says females have some magical power to expel a pregnancy from a rapist!  I am a woman & I have never heard of anything so ridiculous & neither have any of my other female friends!!

Joe Walsh says women don't die from complications due to pregnancy anymore.  Gee, has he discussed this opinion with any real medical professionals lately?  That is still a concern today although it may not happen as often as it once did.  But he chooses not to believe it because it conflicts with his opinion on abortion.

Richard Mourdoch once said that his idea of compromise was forcing democrats to support ALL of their ideas!!  I've got news for him, that's not compromise!!

Blacks should help themselves","Many people might say the economy is the most important issue but I don't agree.  The same politicians who are pushing this 'the economy is bad, we are leaving a mountain of debt to our kids & grandkids' BS are the very same ones who pushed us into debt!!!  When Bush was president, he spent money like it was going out of style & every single republican (including Ryan) voted for all of that spending!  So I don't believe them when they say the economy is the main issue.

I think, the most important issue is income inequality.  Since the 80s, the very rich have gotten a much larger percent of the wealth while everyone else has suffered!  Due to this, we no longer have much of the middle class left!  It's either the very rich or the very poor!  And that's no way to run a country based equality for everyone.  

Republicans will tell you that they can't raise taxes on the job creators (their term for the very rich).  But there's no proof that they have actually created any jobs!!  We've had basically the same tax structure for a decade & yet our economy has suffered & there is no proof that any member of the very rich has created a single job!

Do you know what happens when you give rich people more money?  They invest it, the put it in off shore tax havens or international banks that will give them even greater tax advantages.

Do you know what happens when you give the very poor more money?  They spend it!!  They have to spend it to buy things they need to survive.  And when that happens, the money immediately goes into the economy!  It creates jobs, people start buying things again & consumer confidence rises!

Because even the very rich, if they do create jobs, know that the basic strategy of business is supply & demand.  They're not going to put more money in a business if there is no demand for that product.","the second most is congressional gridlock!!  There are no more centrists in congress anymore.  Everyone either votes for one side or the other.

Republicans are so opposed to allowing Obama any credit that they will oppose anything they think he wants.  There was one example where a few republican co-authored a bill & when Obama said he liked it, all of a sudden, they thought it was a bad idea & voted against it!!  Now either they lied when they wrote it (which is highly unlikely) or they simply changed their mind when they found out Obama liked it.

In no other business in the world, do workers get paid for stopping progress or for slowing things down!  Why do we pay our representatives & senators for doing nothing?","this is kind of similar to the last one but the most important problem is the polarization of the 2 parties.

Everyone knows in govt, you don't get everything you want but you sometimes get the things that are most important to you....it's called compromise.  Anyone who has ever been married should understand that.  

But our govt no longer works like that.  People who were once known as centrists like Chuck Hagel, Olympia Snowe or Lincoln Chaffee have become a dying breed.  We shouldn't seek to punish centrists, we should encourage them!  Because it's because of them that govt is able to accomplish anything at all!!","It is completely unreasonable that some political arguments are not based in fact!  Republicans have come to believe that they can based their arguments on anything they want!

Gay marriage & abortion are based on christianity while our govt has always been operated on a separation of church & state.  You have Todd Akin who believes women can magically repel a rapist's sperm.  You have another republican (I forget his name) who said that evolution is the work of the devil.  And both of these 2 guys sit on the science committee!!  How do you explain that?  2 guys who don't believe in science who are in charge of a science committee!!!

Then you have about 2/3 of republicans who believe Obama was born in Kenya even though his birth certificate from Hawaii has been repeatedly offered as proof!!  They believe the fake Kenya birth certificate but don't believe the word of Hawaii officials who have confirmed the validity of the Hawaiian birth certificate!  Then you have republican politicians who, when asked, won't say that's a lie about the Kenyan thing because it helps them with their republican voters not to tell the truth!

A Senator from my state, Inhofe claims global warming isn't real & that it's a conspiracy by the weather channel to get better ratings!  Even though the weather channel doesn't operate on ratings & our current weather patterns confirm that climate change is real & is damaging the planet more every year!!

Need I go on?","My first thought was that they were trying to destroy the country by attacking the economic base in NY & attacking the govt at the Pentagon.  But a friend told me if they had wanted to do that, all they would have to do is get elected.

Ultimately, I think they accomplished what they wanted to do.  I think they wanted to make a really big show of force to prove to people that al qaeda was a big threat to the world.","I think he won because all of the other candidates were so bad!!  You had Rick Perry who once suggested that his state, Texas should secede from the Union.  Newt Gingrich who lost speaker of the house due to a scandal.  Michele Bachmann who couldn't be more looney!  Herman Cain, a pizza CEO who couldn't say anything without mentioning his 999 tax plan which would have raised taxes (while running in a party that always votes based on lowering taxes).  Ron Paul who seems to have a loyal yet small following & seems to run every 4 years.  Santorum who bases all of his political ideas on christianity not necessarily law.

There simply wasn't a lot to contend with & even then, he barely came out a winner.","He lost because he began sounding too outside of the mainstream.  While many in this country will claim to be christian, I'm not sure how many want their politics to be dictated from the bible.

He did have a good ground game in Iowa & that gave him a good start.  But it's very difficult to do the same in the country as a whole without having a very large organization behind him.","prime minister of the UK","vice president of the US","speaker of the house (US)","chief justice of supreme court","Increased","A great deal","Increased","A great deal","Increased","A great deal","Increased","A great deal","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A great deal","Increased","A moderate amount","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A great deal","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A moderate amount","Increased","A great deal","Larger percent","Larger","1.

If we elect Mitt Romney to be President, we will lose all that we have gained toward women's rights. I do not agree with any of his stance on this, and I think it would set women back 100 years. I have worked with many raped women in our local ER as an RN, and I see the devastation it does to them. For these Republicans to say such stupid things that there is ""legitimate rape"" and that women should ""just take it"", is absolutely absurd. I feel very, very strongly on this issue.","Healthcare. As an RN in the ER, I see too many patients every day with no healthcare, and many have diseases or conditions that affect the lower socioeconomic classes. They are unable to get treatment for these conditions, such as diabetes, because the medications and doctor visits are very cost-prohibitive. Then they end up in the ER for us to treat.","That there is such devicivness between the two parties. It would be better for the common good if they could learn to agree. Or we should just get rid of the two-party political system and their small ""off-shoot"" parties.","Foreign affairs. I don't really understand too much about trades and tarrifs, but believe that we need to stop sending our jobs to China and bring them back to the US. That will help improve our economy as a whole.","They were trying to send a message to the citizens and government of the United States. They want us to butt out of their business and stop trying to interfere with their governments. I don't agree at all with how they went about telling their message, but do agree that we spend too much time and money in other countries' affairs, and not enough here at home.","I think he represented himself to the Republican party as much more conservative than the other candidates. And of course, he has much more money to win the nomination, which despite what people may think, does win elections.","He was too much into his Christian values, and trying to push that on the American people.

I think government stimulus to repair and replace infrastructure would add jobs, help companies and their employees thrive, and would increase tax revenues - something that would be good for the country as a whole. I think the best party to do this are the democrats.","I am very concerned about women's issues in this election, because republicans seem to be very averse to protecting the rights of women. They want to outlaw abortion, do not support equal pay, and want to get rid of healthcare. I don't want special privileges, but I want a government that does not bow to religious pressure and make me abide by such rules. I support Roe v.

I would love for this election to show that a vast majority of people support the idea of working together and compromising on important issues so that Congress and the President can get the economy moving again as it should.

They won't admit it, but I think this is a real problem for our country.","I think the country needs to reform the tax code. I feel that taxes should be increased for the higher income groups. I also think that capital gains, estate taxes and other portions of the tax code that favor very wealthy people should be re-examined and revised. Taxes should be easier to do. There should not be so many ways for wealthy people to get out of paying taxes. I think taking money and work offshore should be severely penalized.","I think they were attacking our way of life.

I lost my job almost a year ago.  That loss was not related to the economy, but I believe my inability to find another is greatly affected by the number of unemployed right now and the economy.  There have been improvements, but I believe there would have been greater improvement if there was a bipartisan effort. I fear Republicans in control because I don't know what they would do (because they aren't really saying), but I don't think I am the type of person that is likely to benefit.","The second most important issue is health care.  I currently have no insurance and can't afford to buy any.  I also have a close relative with a chronic health condition that has not been able to get care because of a lack of insurance. When I did have health insurance through an employer (a small group) the premiums were outrageous.  Employees with family members had to pay nearly $900 additional per month for a family plan.","I think the divide and animosity between the two major political parties is the most important problem.

I don't want a president who says different things in different settings because he is afraid of the backlash. He should stick to one opinion, and leave it at that.","Yes","I love the fact that he is pushing for a new health care law to cover the country's uninsured.

The plan is taking this country in the right direction of providing health care for everyone.","The most important political problem facing the U.S. today is definitely the economy. If the economy isn't in decent shape then people find it hard to focus on anything else. The economy covers a wide range things that concern our country. There is a chain reaction of issues that occur when one aspect of our economy isn't doing well, and it negatively affects the others.","The second most important problem facing the U.S. today is our country's debt.

Like most Americans, we don't want taxes to be raised on the middle class, but on the millionaires, since they earn a lot of money and could live a perfect life without ant impact on their lifestyle, but for middle class, tax raise could be awful and people would not have enough to pay for their bills, buy things and all that.","The second most important issue for me will employment, because as we all know the U.S. is now on a higher unemployment rate than it used to be few years ago. And we all need a job in order to afford our lifestyle.","The most important political problem facing the United States today will be immigration, because I know people come here for a better future and I understand that. The government should allow ONLY honest and hard-working immigrants and not criminals. So we could all have a better country.","I think the second most important political issue facing the United States will be healthcare. I think the government should allow ALL people to have a decent healthcare afforded by the government, and being private, then only people who can afford healthcare will be fine, but how about those who can't. Who help them out?. The government should do that.","I think by them doing those awful things, they were trying make the point that was like ""Hey we could do whatever we want to hurt Americans"". I think that was their point. Sadly they succeed it.","I think Mitt Romney is a strong candidate. I think that was the major reason. He has some points, and some people believed what he is planning.

1) We need to make it easier for a really serious moderate third party.  But the Democrats and the Republicans in all of the states will do anything to prevent that from coming about.
2) We need to have independent commissions draw CD lines to stop the rampant gerry mandering for incumbents on both sides.

3) There is severe unemployment in Muslim countries so the men turn to the streets and to hatred

With the economy struggling to get traction, it is important to elect someone who will give the economy a boost and give everyone a chance to participate in the growing economy not just the rich.","The second most important issue is the role of goverment in the society.  There are many programs that private sector will never invest in because it is not profitable.  Those programs are the responsibility of the government, such as affordable health care and education for everyone.  If the government reduces those programs, we may save some money now but going into the future, the U.S. will fall further behind other countries and lose its competitive advantage.","The most important political problem in the U.S. is the divide between the Democatic Party and Republican Party in Congress.  With the Republican Party out to get President Obama, there has not been cooperation between the party to conduct important government business.  The gridlock in the Congress has been devastating and cause the economy to struggle to improve.","The second most important political problem is the class division.  The Republican Party's labeling of the President Obama's tax policy of raising income tax rate on the rich as class warfare has put the Americans against each other.  Instead of whites against blacks, we now have the rich against poor situation in America.  This class division will lead to divisiveness among Americans.","The terrorists were trying bring fear to American psyche.

I think that he is the best choice when it comes down to improving the economy around and creating more jobs. And his energy policy, which consists of allowing more pipelines and more offshore drilling, will help lowers gas prices and create more jobs.","Yes","Mitt Romney has strong religious beliefs which I do not agree with. His Mormon views and some of his statements about censorship scare me. When he was the governor of Massachusetts he was in favor of a government health care plan for everyone but now he has said that he would repeal Obamacare.","Yes","I like that Obama seems to be moderate and not too extreme in his views. I think that he is trying to what is best for the country. The fact that he pushed for all Americans to have health care is a big positive for me.","No","The huge stimulus that Obama pushed for, has largely failed.

The Democrats favor greatly hurting the economy in order to protect the environment. They also push for higher taxes and always want to cut military spending when it is not wise to do so. The Democrats want a big government that controls peoples' lives which I strongly disagree with.","Yes","I like that the Republicans are in favor of lower taxes and want to create more jobs. I like that Republicans are willing to put aside the environment if it means it will help the economy improve. They are also in favor of a strong military which I think is really important. I like that the Republicans favor small government and personal freedom.","Yes","I don't like that Republicans favor tax cuts for the rich because I do not believe that trickle down economics really work.

I think that if the economy improves, there will be more jobs and more of a possibility for me to move up. The poor economy hurts everyone because it makes the national debt that much harder to pay back and rising food and fuel costs make it that much harder to live.","The second most important issue to me is national healthcare. I have older relatives without health care and who struggle with medical bills. These bills are so large that my relatives will never be able to pay them off. National health care alleviates the stress of large medical bills and the worry about getting sick.","The most important problem facing the United States today is our struggling foreign policy. The United States needs to strike a balance between being a strong military power and staying out of conflicts that drag the country into further debt.  The United States should stop foreign aid to countries that hate America and speak out in favor of attacking us. The hundreds of millions of dollars spent on countries just amounts to political bribery and it does not work.","The second most important political problem is the role of government. It is a difficult balance between meeting the needs of citizens and also not telling people what to do. While I am strongly in favor of social programs and national healthcare I worry that the government is doing too much. The government should be there as a fail safe to help people when they are really in need. The programs social programs provided by the government, like welfare, should not be used long term.","The terrorists were doing what terrorists do which is to cause terror. Their goal was to create fear and cause the United States to spend a huge amount of money and time reacting their heinous act. They wanted to bring the war in the Middle East to the United States and show that the U.S. was vulnerable to attack.","I think Mitt Romney won the Republican Nomination because of his experience as a successful businessman and as a governor. He was the governor of Massachusetts when the state had a balanced budget and passed a statewide health care plan. He is a moderate conservative so that appeals to the majority of Republicans.","I think that Santorum lost the Republican nomination because Mitt Romney has the best chance at beating Obama. I think that Santorum lost because he was too right wing when the majority of Republicans are more moderate. He does not believe in global warming and is in favor of outlawing abortion. The Republicans realized that these views would not get him elected president.","Prime Minister of UK","vice president","speaker of the house","chief justice of the supreme court","Increased","A little","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A little","Increased","A moderate amount","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Decreased","A great deal","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Larger percent","Larger","7.

The job situation is pretty bleak around here, but I must say that I have kind of stopped trying for the most part.  I would not get any responses and if I pursued the opening after submitting my resume, I would get some blow off answer.","The economy has affected many people that I know, a couple of foreclosures, a small business on the verge of bankruptcy and the sharp decline in mortgage values a while back really took a toll on people that had been somewhat secure.  It is scary and depressing to watch helplessly.","The lack of bi-partisimship is a huge problem, although I don't understand as much as I would like to.  The fact that once elections are over the two parties cannot come together as one (for the most part) is very troubling.","The fact that money dominates politics is very unsettling.  It is hard to have faith in the spoken words of politicians when the unspoken dollar is always such a force and motivator beneath everything.","I think that they wanted to shake America's sense of freedom and securtity to the core.

He's a typical Republican candidate, and as such seems to has a certain disregard for people that are not like himself, or so it appears thus far.","No","In general, the Democratic Party seems to care about people, maybe too much, but still they seem to want to help the less fortunate, and I support this policy.","Yes","Barack Obama has done little to nothing in his four years in office, and I do not believe he will or can accomplish anything if he were to be re-elected. Golf seems to be his major interest, and he might have more luck improving his game if he were not burdened by the responsibility of being the leader of the most powerful nation in the world. His policies thus far have been abject failures, he's done nothing to improve the economy, and he's fulfilled none of his campaign promises.

I don't like that they prefer to tax citizens to pay for their initiatives, as opposed to finding another way to pay for them.

Blacks should help themselves","Somewhat important","1. Govt should help blacks","6","The state of the economy is the most important issue for me in this election. Too many people are unemployment, or underemployed, and this situation needs to be addressed and remedied before anything else. Without good jobs for all who want them, the tax base both locally and nationally is substantially decreased, leading to less funding for education and other social programs. Everything in this country comes from business first, since government depends on taxation to fund many programs and services. Also, without a good economic foundation, the level of public debt, such as US Treasury Bills, will suffer, because few nations or individuals will want to invest in them, especially if the nations credit rating is lowered. So, the economy must be improved immediately, without resorting to more socialistic programs that do nothing but create more debt.","The environment is probably the next most important issue for me. I don't believe that either major party candidate has really focused on this issue, although it's been discussed somewhat. I believe that we need a radically new energy policy in this country, one that requires a change away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources, and I believe that this policy needs to be implemented almost immediately. Reducing our dependence on foreign oil would have many immediate benefits which wouldn't be limited to just reducing environmental pollution.","The most important political problem facing the United States today is the economy. It's my belief that everything in this country stems from the economy, it's how our country is structured, from taxation to education. I don't necessarily agree that money should be held as a value above all others, but this country has held this belief for too long for it to be changed anytime soon. So, a strong economy means a strong country, with better educational opportunities for everyone, and a better standard of living as well.","I think the second most important political issue facing our country today is the rise in religious extremists who have come to dominate many high positions in government. Although it may seem as if this isn't really a major concern, I believe it should be. Neo-conservatives led this nation into wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, two countries that were no clear threat to us, and I believe these wars were begun because of the beliefs of a small but powerful group of policy makers who really need to be removed from power as soon as possible. This country should further it's own interests primarily, not the interests of a nation such as Israel.","I believe that the stated intent in perpetrating this act of terrorism was to begin open warfare against the Western world and all that it represents. Causing fear and terror was only one of their goals. Harming our economy was another. Bringing more attention to their plight, the issue for many of them of the injustices that their people have suffered, was another goal.","I think Mitt Romney represents a candidate that is or can be seen as the least threatening person that both Republicans and Democrats could conceivably support enough to win him the election. Someone like Ron Paul is too radical for most people to vote for, even if some of his ideas are novel and could quite possibly improve our country. Other candidates weren't as telegenic as Romney is, and although Romney isn't the most charming or socially adept person out there, he was definitely less inept than the other major Republican candidates.","Santorum seemed to me to be too young, too angry, and too lacking in support from the majority of his party. He also lacked the financial resources of someone like Romney, who has the backing of Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire. Maybe Santorum also was perceived as less experienced and accomplished than someone like Mitt Romney.","Prime Minister, UK","Vice President, USA","Speaker of the House, USA","Chief Justice, Supreme Court, USA","Increased","A moderate amount","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A great deal","Increased","A great deal","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Decreased","A little","Decreased","A little","Decreased","A great deal","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A great deal","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A great deal","Should not determine","Larger","3","Very important","1.

I think that Obama was very idealistic when he took office and I admired him for that. I think that he found the American problems too insurmountable and/or did not receive proper help from his administration and others to make a difference. There is no doubt in my mind that he was trying and he is a very nice guy. But right now this country doesn't necessarily need a ""nice guy."" We need real change and we need it yesterday!","Foreign affairs is another important issue. I think that Obama has done fairly well with this, but there is clearly more work to be done. We need extremely strong leadership so that we will NEVER have another incident like Libya.","It has to be the economy. Without getting out of that hole, the Americans cannot concern themselves with much else. That is such an immediate need right now. I think that foreign policy is also on American's minds, but if you have no house and not much to eat, that would obviously be the only matter of importance right now.","As stated above, it is probably foreign policy. People are sickened and outraged with the incident in Libya. They are also concerned either directly or indirectly with our service people in the current wars.","Who can possibly answer what was going through the minds of these deranged people???? If forced to come up with some answer, I would say that they were trying to prove that they are definitely a group that needs to be reckoned with. Through some misguided vision of their god, they thought they were doing the right (?) thing.

I think it was a huge wake-up call for America to DO SOMETHING!!! We can't be this complacent in everything.

The Republican Party's desire to limit access to abortion and support of policies that would allow insurance companies to get away with not covering birth control are frightening to me. I also support the Lily Ledbetter Act and I think that working to make employment opportunities and salaries more equal is an important issue in this country.","The second most important issue has been healthcare. It's so expensive to have access to even basic health services and medications. I think that the private insurance system has been inflating prices and making it difficult for those who need coverage the most to purchase it. Healthcare needs to be radically restructured. I don't believe that a profit-driven healthcare model is acceptable any longer.","I think that the most important political problem is the economy. People are still out of work and have difficulty paying for necessities like food and housing. I think that creating jobs and offering assistance to help people get back on their feet should be a priority. It's hard to fix any of the other problems in this country when so many people can barely afford to feed their families.","I think that the second most important political problem is women's rights. At this point the infringement on women's ability to make healthcare decisions is being threatened. In a country where paying for basic costs of living is difficult for many, equalizing employment opportunities and salaries for women is really important. Women need to have a voice in the decisions are being made politically, and it seems that that voice is in danger of being limited or taken away entirely.","I think that they were demonstrating their disagreement with the U.S. as a whole. The World Trade Center represented Western economies and the excess that goes with them. I think that they disagreed with the way Western ideals and values were beginning to infiltrate (not entirely by accident) more traditional Muslim societies. I think that the attack was an act of defiance against Western, especially American, culture.","I think that Romney was a charismatic leader. At the start of the campaign he seemed moderate enough to be appealing to those that were undecided. He represents a successful family man who is a good fit with the Republican Party's values without seeming too radical.","I think that Santorum is too radically conservative to appeal to moderates and undecided voters. I think that the Republican Party recognized the fact that his appeal would be limited. His campaign against women's rights made his support from female voters questionable, at best. Overall, I think that he was simply too conservative for this election.","Prime Minister of the UK","Vice President","Speaker of the House","Chief Justice of the Supreme Court","Increased","A little","Increased","A great deal","Increased","A moderate amount","Increased","A moderate amount","Decreased","A moderate amount","Increased","A moderate amount","Increased","A little","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A moderate amount","Cut out entirely","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Decreased","A great deal","Increased","A moderate amount","Larger percent","Larger","3","Somewhat important","3","6","Favor","A great deal","Very important","Favor","Moderately","Oppose","Moderately","Favor","A great deal","Favor","Moderately","Oppose","Strongly","More difficult","Very important","No","1.

Blacks should help themselves","I think the most important issue has been the economy and the plans to increase jobs in the U.S.   It is critical that whoever wins the election needs to have a viable plan in place to improve the economy.   I believe that Obama has a better plan and I believe that we're starting to see some of the benefits in the recent numbers.  I also believe that Obama made good decisions in 2009 to help with the bailout of the auto industry and I believe that is starting to pay some dividends for the U.S.   I think that Romney's plan would deregulate a lot of industry and risk the potential for another financial crisis like we had in 2008.","The second most important issue to me personally is the need to (a) address global warming and (b) focus on renewable energy and energy independence.   I believe that we putting the U.S. at risk if we continue to stay focused on our oil consumption habits.  I know that Obama had a couple failures in his first term with alternative energy but I applaud him for at least trying to stimulate and promote that for the U.S.   I also think the recent Hurricane Sandy has shown that climate change is a real problem and we need leaders who will listen and prioritize that and work with other world leaders on solutions.","The most important political problem facing the U.S. today is unemployment.   The global economy is changing, and as a country, we need to be able to react and grow and develop new industries that will create new jobs.  We can't depend on the existing industries to always replenish jobs as existing jobs disappear or move overseas.   I don't think it makes sense to try and force companies to keep jobs in the U.S.  I think we need to develop new industries and skills that make the U.S. a leader in that area.","The second most important political problem facing the United States today is our poor educational system.  If we're going to stay competitive in the global economy, we need to improve and strengthen our educational system - especially in the areas of math and science.   We need to make education a strength - especially in our inner cities - as this will help to give disadvantaged youth a way to escape a lifetime of poverty and crime.   Education is the key in today's global economy and as a country, we need to make it a higher priority within our social and cultural environments.","I think that the terrorists were trying to make a statement about American cultural values and how the west has all the ""advantages"" and has been persecuting the foreigners by invading their countries and using their oil.   I think that the terrorists also believe, through their Muslim religion, that they would become martyrs for their actions and would ascend into a higher state.   I also think that the terrorists wanted to set an example for their breathen and encourage other people to sacrifice themselves to make these statements.","I think that Mitt Romney won the Republican nomination because he appears to be the strongest leader with the best chance of defeating Obama.   I also think that Mitt Romney appealed to people with his economic plans and his commitment to turn around the economy.    I also think that he was viewed as more socially moderate (as compared to Rick Santorum) and this worked in his favor.","I think that Rick Santorum lost the Republican nomination because he was viewed as too much of an intellectual and not a strong leader for the nation.  He always wore sweaters and looked more like your college professor instead of the President of the United States.  I also think he was viewed as too socially conservative for many people in the United States and this worked against him.","Prime Minister of Great Britain","Vice-President of the U.S.","Speaker of the House","Chief Justice Supreme Court","Increased","A moderate amount","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A great deal","Increased","A great deal","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A little","Decreased","A little","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Decreased","A little","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A great deal","Larger percent","Larger","2","Extremely important","2","7.

That being said, I don't think there's anything that the President can do to personally fix the economy as a whole.  What they can do though is keep the deficit from getting worse, while the economy fixes itself.","Healthcare is definitely number 2, but it relates directly to #1.  Even with the new healthplan at my job being a lot worse than the current one, I still don't feel that we should be wasting tax dollars/time guaranteeing healthcare for everyone.  Healthcare is a privilege, not a right.","Continued weak economy, and the wide ranging effects on everything else in our country.   There's no way to even hold our own, much less grow, with the weak economy and fears' affect on spending.","Continued deficit spending and increase in government debt is an ongoing problem that has to be addressed.  At some point, you can't even get enough taxes to service the interest on your debt, and we are getting there quickly.  With the weak economy, tax revenue keeps dropping, exacerbating the problem.","Like all terrorist attacks, the purpose of 9-11 was to institute change.  Whether you are trying to free Ireland from British control or get US interests out of the middle east, the goals of terrorist actions are always the same.

That is how I feel about abortion.  I feel like in cases of rape or incest a person should be allowed to have an abortion, but it has to be only extreme cases like that.  Then when he changed it talking about banning it in all cases it made me look twice.  That is the only thing that would have made me vote for Mitt Romney or a Republican candidate.","Yes","Mitt Romney has been flip flopping on the issues since day one, and it's unclear at least to me where he really stands on some of the issues because he has continually changed his view point.  With the economy I feel that you should pay a higher tax percentage on higher income, and republicans definitely don't feel that way.  I feel that the government has a part in investing in the future education of it's people, because not everyone can afford to borrow money from their parents to go to school.  The government should also invest in things such as science and research, because just leaving it with the private sector is getting the US passed up.","Yes","He stood on the issues.  I feel like he is actually looking out for the interest of middle class families like mine.  He supports the rights for gay people to marry and I am for that I believe people should be able to marry who they want to.  He is also investing in the country's future.  I feel like now our young people are getting a better education.  The schools in my city have all been rebuilt in the last 4 years, the kids have new books.  These schools where old when I was going to them and we were using books over 15 years old at the time so it's a big thing.  Plus he wants more teachers hired which will mean smaller classrooms and the ability to take time out with the kids.","Yes","His stand on abortion that it is the woman's choice.  I have always be taught that if you lay down with a boy and get pregnant you take care of your kids.  Also I believe life begins at conception. This is the only thing that would really make me vote against Obama.","30","80","40","80","20","90","95","777","0","88","35","80","30","0","90","20","Yes","The democratic party tends to be more about the people.  The democratic party is more liberal and I just seem to identify more with the views of the democratic party.  To me the democratic party looks at the country as a whole instead of just the top 10 percent.  The democratic party makes me feel like my country actually has my back, instead of just do your duty fight for your country and be forgotten.","No","No like it all.","Yes","I like the conservative views on some of the issues that the republican party puts out.  Such as some views on abortion, but that is just about all that I like about the Republican party.","Yes","Even though I like the Republican party's conservative views on abortion, i don't like their views on gay marriage, the economy, or foreign policy.  I feel that everyone should be allowed to marry who they want to.  The republican's views on the economy to me seem one sided.  The rich get richer and the poor stay poor.  Republicans would allow companies all sort of tax breaks for sending companies overseas, because they can make more money their but it takes away from jobs in the US.  I don't like that Republican's are more quickly to go to war, like they have to have a war.  I understand that there is a time for war, but there is also a time for peace.","Better when one party controls both","Very similar","Very similar","Better","Yes","Somewhat","Better","Much","Yes","Yes","No","Never","Yes","Very often","No","Never","Yes","Very often","Yes","Occasionally","No","Never","Yes","Occasionally","No","Never","Never","Extremely well","A moderate amount","A lot","Moderately successfully","Most of them","Slightly liberal","Liberal","Liberal","Conservative","Slightly liberal","Extremely conservative","Care a good deal","Barack Obama","Will be close","Mitt Romney","Win by quite a bit","No, didn't vote in primary or caucus","I didn't vote in a primary or caucus","Yes, have a duty","Disagree strongly","Agree strongly","Disagree somewhat","Disagree somewhat","Gotten better","Somewhat","Get better","Much","Get better","Much","Get worse","Somewhat","Better","Somewhat","Less","About the same","I answered About the same to the previous question","Less","Could borrow from someone","100","Most people can be trusted","Most of the time","Democrats","Democrats","Republicans","Stronger","Agree","Democrat","Strong","I do not consider myself an Independent","Extremely well","Extremely well","Extremely well","Extremely well","Extremely well","Quite well","Extremely well","Quite well","Not too well","Not too well","Not too well","Extremely well","Not too well","Extremely well","6","Very important","7.

Blacks should help themselves","The most important issue to me personally in this election has been healthcare.  On once side there is the obama care plan which would require everyone to have health insurance but it is made affordable.  On the other hand there is what Romney and Ryan are calling a voucher system for the elderly.  I feel like the Republicans are trying to phase out medicare, but the elderly really need this.","The second most important issue is  situation with Iraq.  I feel like Obama has a plan and he is sticking to it.  Gradually he is pulling troops out of Iraq by a preset timetable.  The troops are over there training Iraq's people to take care of themselves.  Romney wants to send more troops over there keep fighting, I just don't see his purpose in it, because right we have to start taking care of home.  To go back to keep fighting a war that has ended is a waste of lives, and money.","I feel that the economy is the most important political problem the United States is currently facing.  People cant really find a job, not having enough money to cover the basics of life.  The economy is the most important political problem because it effects everyone from the richest to the poorest.  Plus the economy effects just about every other part of the government.","The second most important political problem facing the United States is foreign policy.  Everything from how foreign trade is handled, whether or not we give aid to foreign countries in need, and the Iraq situation.  Nearly every foreign disaster the US has had people on the ground lending a hand or bringing food and much needed supplies, but at the same time America has to take care of home.","I believe that the terrorists were trying to terrify and put fear in the hearts of Americans.  I believe that they were trying to prove that they could hurt us.  I believe that they where saying here we are what do you plan to do about it and I strongly supported Bush for striking back because that was an act of war.  I believe that the terrorist thought that America was going to run like a scared dog with it's tail between it's legs.","I believe that Mitt Romney won the Republican nomination because his views are so obscure.  It seems at one point of time he's taken just about every possible view that there is to take.  I believe that he won the republican nomination because of his faith and being a family and businessman.  I think the main reason though is that he has a 5 point plan.  Nobody knows what that plan is exactly but i guess he made it sound good.","Rick Santorum dropped out I think after his daughter got sick his heart wasn't really in the fight anymore.  I also believe that at some point he realized that he couldn't put the job in front of his own family.  I believe that in those places where he wasn't nominated it was because he had clear views and they just couldn't compete with Romney's obscurity.","UK prime minister","Vice President","Speaker of the house","Chief Justice","Increased","A little","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Increased","A moderate amount","Increased","A great deal","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Decreased","A moderate amount","Increased","A little","Kept about the same","I answered Kept about the same or Cut out entirely to the previous question","Decreased","A moderate amount","Increased","A little","Larger percent","Larger","3","Somewhat important","2","7.

They also proved that these things have to be dealt with at the time they happen, and not wait years. The trade center was bombed before with nothing really being done. The submarine was bombed with nothing really being done. The 911 happened. They should have been dealt with years before so this didn't happen.","Because he was the strongest candidate for the Republican party and seen as someone that can turn things around.","He was too much of an unknown at the time of his running.

The primary reason I might vote for him is that I believe our country needs a new and better direction for the future. While I am somewhat impressed by his business accomplishments, I'm not sure that would be reason alone for voting him into the office of the President. My sense is that he might set aside many of the political issues that seem to be dividing our country and fixing our various problems.","Yes","I am totally disillusioned by his utter lack of understanding the basic and day-to-day problems that 99% of American families face. I believe he has been very wealthy for so long that he has insulated himself from what ordinary folks deal with in this country. This lack of empathy and understanding is extremely worrisome in terms of voting for Mitt Romney.","Yes","I may vote for President Obama since he is already in the office of the Presidency and has had several years of experience in the position. I believe he understands how difficult it is to change the country's course and also knows what needs to get done to turn around the fortunes of our great nation.","Yes","His performance to date has been overall disappointing. I believe it's not all his fault but would have hoped that he would have been more aggressive and face up to the Republican Congress more often. He clearly is also influenced by the nonsense within the Democratic party and needed to stand up to them too. I may not vote for him if I think about these issues too much.","0","75","25","80","5","80","90","0","0","15","0","5","0","0","0","0","Yes","I like that the Democratic is pro Middle Class and typically is interested in improving the working and living conditions of most Americans. This is a difficult mission but I believe the Democratic party tries harder than the opposing party to improve the average Joe's existence.","Yes","I particularly dislike the Democratic party's reluctance to be more or as aggressive as the Republican party to get across important points to the American public. My sense is that the Democratic party is sometimes afraid or bashful to promote itself and its agendas with the same voracity as the Republicans.","Yes","The current & new Republican party is absolutely a fraud. The Republican party that I loved and was a part of was known for standing up for free enterprise, freedom, and important values which seems to have gone out of style. The party has been hijacked by a group of pathetic, war-mongering elites that are almost as bad as the top echelons of the Democratic party!","Yes","The current Republican party is too insular, too guided by religious zealots and seems to enjoy war mongering as the only form of national security. I believe the Republican party will continue to shrivel down to nothing unless it changes its ways particularly for younger voters.

Blacks should help themselves","The important issue for me has been how the Middle Class will fare going forward regardless of political party. I firmly believe neither candidate has any real solutions or political gumption to improve the worsening situation for our country's Middle Class. Work, savings, investments, home values and how we can help our children succeed are all rolled into this core issue and so far, neither Obama or Romney has convinced me that they will improve or reverse our situation.","The second most important issue for me is government investments in our national defense, not military spending, but rather our infrastructure, education, healthcare and improving our competitiveness against the insane resources that countries like China, Russia and India will have in the global arena.","Our politicians are too self-centered, too concerned about their public service careers and allegiance to their parties. Lack of real direction and leadership is the single most problematic aspect of American politics today.","I believe the second most important political problems is the infiltration of corporations and their monied lobbyists. It seems that the real agenda of the Congress is no longer about serving citizens of the greater good of the United States but instead its new master is global corporations, foreign states and industry groups which often have anti-citizen/consumer and anti-US objectives.","They were attempting to send a message about how we are not safe in this country and that our financial institutions and symbols were at risk from attack given our country's prominence within the world and various government/foreign relations positions we have taken over the years.","I believe Mitt Romney won the Republican nomination because is fits some idyllic, 1950s throwback image of leadership in this country. He is definitely the polar opposite of Barack Obama and was more confident and held his own more than the litany of our Republican hopefuls we saw rolled out before us over the past 2 years.  I also  believe he won due to his sheer financial backing which seems to be more important than any real issue positions in today's sound-bite dominated world.","Rick Santorum lost due to his over zealous religious double-talk. I believe his stated positions were not only non-Christian but completely out of touch with most Americans.  He is a another example of the type of political scumbag (often times Democrats) we used to see in the 1970s.

It would reduce taxes, but it would hurt more than it would help.

Romney wants to cut back on education and loans for students. I am currently going to college and I could not attend without being able to borrow for my tuition. My grants cover 1/3 of the cost because of how high tuition has gotten. No one will be able to afford to get a career and will not be able to find a job.","The economy has gotten out of control. I don't know much about this issue though. I get confused when people start talking about the economy, but I know it is bad. It is difficult to find a job, and when you do get a job the pay is low and you are barely making it.","Health care. There has been a lot of talk about the health care plans.

Blacks should help themselves","I guess the biggest issue to me has been how out-of-touch the candidates are with ordinary people like my family. I was angry at Obama because if the health care ""reform"" laws -- like he thinks if you order someone to buy an overpriced, broken product, that magically makes it affordable and effective. But at least he's trying to help. Romney's just a jerk. I don't have a job right now. Shockingly, lacking an income, I don't pay income tax. So according to Romney, that makes me a parasite who can't be reasoned with and who will never accomplish anything, as opposed to a 26-year-old with no work experience in a crappy economy.","Probably health care. I don't have health insurance right now, and that does scare me sometimes. But I don't have it because I can't afford it. I don't want to be ordered to get health insurance. I want the system fixed! When insurance is affordable and actually pays medical bills, I'll buy it on my own. And if someone else DOESN'T want to buy it, that should be their decision. The government's job is to make it accessible, not to force people to buy it.","I think the economy is a pretty big problem. It seems to be recovering a little -- or at least among people I know, more and more of them have jobs and aren't worried about money as much anymore. But we need to keep an eye on it and make sure it keeps improving.","I think we need to reevaluate the ""War on Drugs"". It's costing a lot of money, overcrowding the prison system and keeping the police both too busy and too unpopular to be 100% effective at preventing crimes that have actual victims.","They wanted to kill a bunch of people, to get attention for their cause and probably to become martyrs and earn a place in Heaven. They probably also wanted to scare the US into giving them whatever they wanted, although that kind of backfired unless what they wanted was for us to attack several Middle Eastern countries.","I have no idea.
